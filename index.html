                        <p class="block5__txt">ENSO’s non-invasive neuromodulation treatment consists of high frequency electrical pulses delivered across the skin to suppress the activity of the nerves in the painful area. </p>
                        <p class="block5__title2">How does it feel?</p>
                        <p class="block5__txt">This nerve suppression is experienced as a slight sensation of numbness, and is different from the mode action of traditional forms of neuromodulation treatments such as TENS devices.</p>
